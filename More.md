#Alumni Majors and Careers at Grinnell College
###Toby Baratta
As Grinnellians, we often hear about the diverse routes that students take. We know that many alum go into the Peace Corps or into Public Service, but not exactly why or from what majors. To solve this question, David Hanle and myself were commissioned to create a visualization of majors to career paths.  We wanted to know who went to medical school and who went into academia, at any level. 

We were given a dataset of alumni dating back to 1932, however we only used from 1970 onwards in our analysis. Then, we separated the majors based on their divisions, and grouped careers into related fields to the best of our ability regarding skills used and relationships.  These groups ended up being:
•	Law
•	Business and Management
•	Communications
•	Computer & Information Systems
•	Engineering: Non-CS related
•	Finance & Insurance
•	Government, Politics, and General Social Sciences
•	Higher Education
•	Arts and Entertainment
•	Marketing
•	Medicine
•	Museum and Archival Sciences and Theology
•	Other Education: K-12 education, special education, district supervisors, etc
•	Public Service & Volunteer Work
•	Sciences & Math 
•	Other: Some jobs didn’t really fit into any of these categories, but were too small to make into their own category. These were grouped under “other”. 

The methodology regarding the grouping was done based on simplicity and to ensure that the visualization was readable, even at the sacrifice of small details of individual majors. The full dataset can be requested through Grinnell College Department of Alumni Relations, but as it contains personal identifiable information is not posted publically sans in the aggregate used for the visualization.

Then, given these groupings from majors to careers, we created a final visualization that can be seen here at http://dasil.grinnell.edu/data-visualizations/alumni-data-chord-graph/ . The mapping was not one-to-one from major to career, as those with double majors were counted twice to ensure that the majors were fairly represented for their careers rather than dealing with the exact counts. The source code is not specific to this dataset at all and has been used to visualize other things, such as Egypt’s imports and exports worldwide. The code and instructions on how to apply it to another dataset can be found here, on Github.
A few notable observations from the dataset would be that students from all disciplines end up all over the map. While there are some simple trends within the dataset such as biology students going to medical school and computer science majors going into computer science, there are English majors also doing the same things. Whether these are just double majors or Grinnell truly does provide a liberal arts education that can be applied across disciplines is hard to confidently say with this analysis, however it gives a good picture of the variety of paths that are truly Grinnellian.

More analysis can be done on the original dataset regarding trends, particularly taking into account that some majors are younger than others (Gender, Women, & Sexuality Studies or Computer Science, for instance) and taking better account of double majors could be done. Also having better ways of dealing with the unemployed or unclassifiable might be of use for seeing other trends in post-Grinnell life, or perhaps an over-time analysis of jobs. Graduate school would also be an interesting indicator of future goals that could be analyzed as well, so the work on majors and career paths is certainly not achieved. However, this gives us a quick and elegant way of doing some basic analysis on Grinnellian culture and goals across majors, disciplines, and careers.
